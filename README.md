## The Drama of the Gifted Child

*The Drama of the Gifted Child* by Alice Miller explores the lasting impact of childhood experiences, particularly how children often suppress their true emotions and needs to meet the expectations of their caregivers. This self-denial can lead to emotional struggles and disconnection in adulthood, but Miller offers insights into breaking these patterns and reconnecting with one’s authentic self.

Now, I have to say—I wish this book had a different title. But as you get further into it, you'll come to understand the deeper meaning behind it: the "gift" isn’t about intellect or achievement, but the profound ability of children to adapt and survive emotionally, often at great personal cost.
