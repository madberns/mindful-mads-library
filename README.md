## The Drama of the Gifted Child

*The Drama of the Gifted Child* by Alice Miller explores the lasting impact of childhood experiences, particularly how children often suppress their true emotions and needs to meet the expectations of their caregivers. This self-denial can lead to emotional struggles and disconnection in adulthood, but Miller offers insights into breaking these patterns and reconnecting with one’s authentic self.

Now, I have to say — don't judge a book by it's book title. The "gift" isn’t about intellect or achievement, but the profound ability of children to adapt and survive emotionally in childhood, often at great personal cost.
